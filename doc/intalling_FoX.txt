You need the FoX (A Fortran library for XML) to compile this program.

The homepage of the project is: http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earawa/FoX/

The installation involves compiling the source code from file, and thus it should be possible to compile in any enviroment 
with a standard Fortran compiler and usual unix compilations tool, like make. You do not need to run any command as sudo.

1. Create a folder SU3SimSuit/src/lib 
1. Download the software from: http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earawa/FoX/source/
   a) Choose the version you want to use. I verified everything is working with versions 4.1.0 and 4.1.2. Download the full version.
   b) Save the file on the folder SU3SimSuit/src/lib you created above

2. Extract it using
$tar -xvf FoX-4.1.2-full.tar.gz

3. Rename the extracted folder to FoX
$ mv FoX-4.1.2-full FoX

4. Enter on it and configure
$.configure
   a)If you are using intel compiler, use instead:  $./configure FC=ifort

5. Compile it
$make

Now, one can compile using something like
gfortran `src/lib/FoX/FoX-config` test.f90 -o test.run
