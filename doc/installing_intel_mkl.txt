You need the Intel Math Kernel library (MKL) to compile this program. Intel supplies this library freely. 
Here I document its installation in a Debian-based system, i.e. using apt-get. I tested it on a "Bash 
on Ubuntu on WIndows" (part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL) distribution and thus shoulkd work 
in "true Linux" as well. Lines starting with a '$' can be executed as normal user. Lines starting with 
a '#' needs to be executed as root, e.g. using sudo.

This guide, up to step 4, is a short version of the more detailed version made by Intel, available at:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-113-install-guide

Notice: By downloading Intel Performance Libraries and Intel Distribution for Python you agree
to the terms and conditions stated in Intel EULA. The EULA is available at the same page
of the original Intel guide

1. Download and install the GPG key for the Intel repository

$ wget https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS-2019.PUB
# apt-key add GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS-2019.PUB

2. Add the Intel repository to the repository list.

# wget https://apt.repos.intel.com/setup/intelproducts.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intelproducts.list

Note: This repository contains all the Intel Performance Libraries and the Intel Distribution for Python.
If you are interested on these, this guide can be used as well

3. Update the metadata of the packages available

# apt-get update

4. Install the MKL

# apt-get install intel-mkl

5. Now we need to add the compile variables to our envirment. Open your .profile file (located
under your home folder) and add at the bottom

source /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries/linux/bin/compilervars.sh -arch intel64 -platform linux

6. Reboot (close all shell windows if under WSL) or

$ source ~/.profile

This concludes the necessary configuration. You may test if everything is working by going to the 
root of the project and issuing

$ make all FC=gfortran

========================
Note. If you are facing trouble, check if the variable $MKLROOT is set.
In case no, you may want to run the script located in

opt/intel/composerxe/linux/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh

Of course, these instructions are for Debian-based systems. Other systems
have different installation procedures, e.g. for arch-linux, one uses
the AUR repository.
